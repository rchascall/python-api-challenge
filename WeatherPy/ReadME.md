Module 6 Challenge - What's the Weather Like?

Three Observable Trends for Part 1

Temperature vs. Latitude
1.Temperatures warm nearer the equator.  Additionally, the data show there is a strong correlation between temperature and latitude.  That said, the correlation is weaker in the Southern Hemisphere.

Humidity vs. Latitude
2.The data show that humidity seems to be higher in the upper latitudes (Northern Hemisphere), but overall the data seems to show minimal correlation between humidity and latitude.

3.Cloudiness & Windspeed vs. Latitude seems to be fairly distributed without regard for latitude and therefore both have a weak correlation to latitude.
